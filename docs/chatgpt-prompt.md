# Prompt for Chat GPT to generate this code

Rather than trust the authors of this repo or auditing their code, you may ask Chat GPT to generate the code for you. Be
sure to test any generated code before relying on it!

> Write a python script that prompts the user for a unicode secret and creates 3 shares of it that recreate it when XOR'ed together. Say each share will be for a different trusted person to keep track of called a "shareholder". These shares are related, so let's say they make up one set.
>
> Do this for every combination of 3 out of 5 known shareholders, #1-#5. there are 10 such combinations, so there should be 10 sets. Let's identify sets by A-J.
>
> At the end, print all shares across sets organized by shareholder:
>
> Shareholder 1:
> Set A:  a048d...
> Set B: ...
> Set C: ...
> ...
>
> Shareholder 2:
> ...
>
> Please be sure to use a secure random function.
>
> Please also write a separate script file to reconstruct the secret, prompting for any 3 shares generated by the splitting code.
